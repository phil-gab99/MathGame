# MathGame

MathGame is my first project at attempting to make a functional android
application using the tools provided by Android Studio while mainly coding
using the atom code editor.

## Java and XML

The application is written in Java and uses some of the classes present within
dedicated android packages.

XML is used for the main application interface window with which the user can
interact with.
